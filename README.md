# Data Analysis - Fifa 23 Players Rating vs Potential
Understanding the player's potential and how to maximize player &amp; teams
## Introduction
As a kid, I loved soccer and still do. One way of showing my love for sports was to build teams in the video game series "**FIFA**." A challenge was finding good players, old or young, and understanding their potential. Since the potential is a hidden in-game statistic, a lot of guessing and hoping at players' current overalls were done. This project will provide some clarity on how to find/maximize the potential of players and make the little kid in me happy.

The video game **FIFA 23**, created by **EA Sports**, is a soccer video game where the users can play as playable soccer players and build teams with real-life players. The game, released on September 20th, 2022, contains players with stats surrounding different mechanics in the game as well as a *market value*, *general overall*, *potential overall*, and other related details to the real-life player. These features that are close to real-life soccer players allow users to build and develop teams based on their *potential* or *current overall*. The competitive landscape of **FIFA 23** has caused users to find the best possible ways to make a team in order to win. This analysis focuses on "What is the best apporach possible team factoring players *overall* vs *potential*?" Finding a relationship between *potential* and *overall* rating involves many other factors that may positively aid users in building teams and wanting to maximize their teams, such as *market value*, *positions* and *age*. Considering these, users have a wide selection of players with challenging decisions when building a team. By the end of the analysis, the goal is to understand an efficient way to create a team with the relationships of *overall*, *potential* and general player stats or further explore player stats that may factor in team building. The report may be useful to other in-game mechanics, such as scouts, who find game-generated players based on users' requests or lead to other critical questions regarding players' wide variation of stats.
